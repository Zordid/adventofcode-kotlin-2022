# Advent Of Code 2022
Solutions in [Kotlin][kotlin], the most **fun** languge on the planet!

My solutions to the ingenious Advent Of Code 2022[^aoc] by Eric Wastl.

This is my ~~fifth~~ sixth year of Advent of Code coding in a row - my body gets trained again to get up at 5:45 in the morning for almost a month... the addiction is real! This year even more coders are saving Christmas using Kotlin - thanks to JetBrains' support and their cool content! Thx, [Sebi][sebi]

If you are into programming, logic, maybe also a little into competition, this one is for you as well!

## My logbook of 2022

### [Day 7][7]: No Space Left On Device
Ok, again a heavy input parsing task! Give me a log of your terminal output and I will calculate the total bytes per directory. Of course I suspected that there will be more difficult questions coming up so I made two Maps - one holding each file, one for each directory.
The first approach to parse is simply iterating over the output, remembering the present working directory `pwd` and "understanding" each possible output making sure that unknown lines will be reported with an error. That's one way to quickly see that you missed one of the instructions in the puzzle text.
My first failure was that I indeed did not accumulate the files in deeper directories to *all* of the directories above. So, I had to fix that. After that, it all went well.

Part 2 was a different story. Even though I was *immediately* sure it would be easy, I did the most stupid of *all* mistakes. Because my setup allows me to safeguard me from wrong answers, I can add the expected answer to the test input. So I did. Looking for what's wanted, my eyes stopped at "choose the smallest: d" and I added "d" as the correct answer for the demo data...
My part 2 worked like a charm, the expected output matched and I submitted my smallest directory *name* that would do the trick... and it did not work out...
AoC's answer was that *maybe* I am **not looking at the full data set**!

Starting to look for what's wrong, I went all directions: 
- in which format should I submit a directories name? Just its name or its full path?
- should I add the first "/" at the beginning or not?
- maybe my algorithm is wrong after all?

It did not occur to me that I was not supposed to answer with the total size of that directory instead of its name... for almost 15 minutes I turned around and around, trying to remember what I had submitted already, not to submit something twice. ...until I *read* the task again. 

Lessons learned: **RTFM**!

### [Day 6][6]: Tuning Trouble
I do not like puzzles that are way too easy. This one turns out to be a one liner and the adaptations from part 1 to part 2 is nothing more than changing the only magic number. Why did I even get up that early? Well, to lose my leaderboard position it is. 
Got my fingers completely tangled when trying to copy & paste my second result - pasted total crap (code) into it and hit Enter too fast. Got blocked for one minute, cursed, waited - and then entered a wrong result, because I did not take that minute to check my code properly. Nightmares at 6 in the morning...
The solution to this puzzle in Kotlin - again a one-liner! Easy. How to find the first occurrence of
a sub string within a string that consists of n different characters? Just write that statement:

    val s = "bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz"
    val len = 4
    val pos = s.asIterable().windowed(size = len).indexOfFirst { it.toSet().size == len }

Note: the `asIterable()` is needed to make windowed() deliver `List<List<Char>>` (without creating a list instance as `toList()` would do!

### [Day 5][5]: Supply Stacks
Luckily my first intuition worked out that building a quick parser helps to speed up my processing. Others in my leaderboard tried to copy&paste it manually and made some mistakes with that manual labor, so I finally got back to position 1.

Initially I went right to using ArrayDeque as the data structure for the stacks, but later reverted that to immutable Lists - if you don't require the speed from optimized data structures, maybe you should not use them in the first place? ;-)

### [Day 4][4]: Camp Cleanup
This was a nightmare to parse because I got my fingers tangled - not a good start at all. But the problem, once you got the data in the right format, is pretty easy. It's all about ranges and overlapping and containing. To my surprise, the Kotlin standard library does not define operator functions for that purpose. You can check whether an int is within a range using the operator function `contains` by just saying `n in range`, but you cannot ask whether another range is contained in a range.

So, operator overload to the rescue!

    private operator fun IntRange.contains(other: IntRange) =
        first >= other.first && last <= other.last

Because this is checking for one range contained in another, you have to reverse the question by flipping around the intervals and combining the results with or

    first in second || second in first

For part two, an infix function `overlaps` can be defined to check for partial overlapping

    private infix fun IntRange.overlaps(other: IntRange) =
        first <= other.last && last >= other.first

This time, one check is enough, because the operation is commutative: `first overlaps second` - Done.

### [Day 3][3]: Rucksack Reorganization
Lost my position 1 on our private leaderboard... *sigh*
It took me a little too long to read the text and properly understanding it. My first iteration had some require statements to safe me from doing stupid stuff, like not splitting in right the middle of the rucksack's items list. Nice finding for the priority calculation, though. Instead of some "magic" numbers when dealing with codepoint arithmetic, you can easily write an easy to comprehend priorities list in Kotlin like this:

    val priorites: List<Char> = ('a'..'z') + ('A'..'Z')

Sweet. Of course this lacks a bit of performance, but might be more understandable than if's and `c - 'A' + 27`!

Addition: thanks to a colleague, my splitting of the rucksack items in half looks nicer now:

    val (itemsIn1: Set<Char>, itemsIn2: Set<Char>) = rucksack.chunked(rucksack.length / 2) { it.toSet() }

### [Day 2][2]: Rock Paper Scissors
I do not like to type `this[0]` and `this[1]` in the morning... use destructuring more often when dealing with input data helps! To avoid `if else` or `when` hell, map Rock, Paper, Scissors onto the values 0, 1 and 2 - winning means being exactly 1 "above" your opponents value - wrapping around at the value 2. One of the important aspects today is to use `mod` function instead of `%` operator, which is the remainder and not floor division and helps you to correctly "go down" one step.

Addition: an interesting way to destructure a String without using split is to convert it to a List which is giving you the inherent destructuring tools. Here, only the first and third characters were of interest:

    val (first, _, third) = s.toList()

### [Day 1][1]: Calorie Counting
Done for today - the fight is real to get up as early as 5:45 again for almost one month! But, it worked. At least I did not mess this one up. ;-)

    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015. 
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
