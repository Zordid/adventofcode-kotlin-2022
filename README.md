# Advent Of Code 2022
Solutions in [Kotlin](https://www.kotlinlang.org/), the most fun language on the planet!

My solutions to the ingenious [Advent Of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/)
by Eric Wastl.

This is my ~~fifth~~ sixth year of Advent of Code coding in a row - my body gets trained again
to get up at 5:45 in the morning for almost a month... the addiction is real!
This year even more coders are saving Christmas using Kotlin - thanks to JetBrains' support and their cool content! Thx, [Sebi](https://github.com/SebastianAigner)

If you are into programming, logic, maybe also a little into competition, this one is for you as well!

### Day 1: Sonar Sweep
Done for today - the fight is real to get up as early as 5:45 again for almost one month! But, it worked. At least I did not mess this one up. ;-)
